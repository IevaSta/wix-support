                        web. It's the text that people
                        type into a browser in order to reach your site, for example wix.com. This makes it easier for
                        visitors to find your site and helps to make your web presence more professional, by providing a
                        distinct online space for your company and brand.You can browse and purchase a domain directly from
                        Wix for your site.Before you begin: To connect your domain, you must upgrade your site to one of our

                        see if they're available, and choose the best time period for your needs – 1 to 3 years.To purchase

                    <h3>Connecting or Transferring a Domain Purchased Elsewhere to Your Wix Account</h3>
                    <p class="trending-story--webkit">Your domain is the address of your website that people type in the
                        browser URL bar to visit your
                        website, for example, www.mystunningwebsite.com.You can connect or transfer a domain you've already
                        purchased from another provider to your Wix site. In this way, you can have more control over
                        managing your domain details from one central location - your Wix account. Learn more about
                        transferring vs. connecting a domain to your Wix account to learn which option suits your needs.
                        Important: You must upgrade your site with a Premium plan to connect or transfer a domain. You'll
                        need access to your current domain registrar before you connect or transfer a domain. The registrar
                        is the company that hosts your domain. If you don't know who your domain registrar is, you can find
                        out by visiting whois.com and entering your domain name to see your domain details. Connecting a
                        domain to your siteConnecting your domain to Wix (also known as “domain mapping”) means that the
                        domain management stays with your current domain host, but the URL of your domain points to your Wix
                        site. This means that when people type in your web address (e.g. www.mywebsite.com) they will be be
                        brought to your Wix site. There are two ways in which you can connect your domain to Wix - via name
                        servers or via pointing. The method you use to connect your domain determines where the DNS records
                        of your domain are hosted. DNS (Domain Name System) records tell your domain where to go to load
                        your website. If you want to connect a domain you already own to your Wix account, we strongly
                        recommend you do so by changing its name servers.Name servers vs. pointing:Learn more about the
                        differences between connecting your domain by name servers vs. by pointing.Connecting via
                        nameservers (recommended method)With this connection method, Wix hosts your DNS records, while your
                        domain remains registered with its current host. This means that your Wix site appears online when
                        someone enters your domain name URL into a web browser. Entering your details takes 5 minutes, and
                        we'll walk you through the process.Follow our steps to connect your domain to the Wix name
                        servers.Connecting via pointingBy connecting via the pointing method, your DNS records are hosted
                        outside of Wix. We do not recommend pointing because we're unable to assist you with issues that may
                        arise in another DNS host's account. However, if your domain has complicated DNS records (e.g.
                        Office 365 email) that you prefer not to reconfigure, pointing may be your best option. Learn how to
                        connect your domain via the pointing method. Transferring a domain to WixIf you’ve already purchased
                        a domain from another provider, it may be possible to transfer that domain from its current
                        registrar to Wix. This option, independent of a domain’s connection method, lets you manage not only
                        your domain records at Wix, but also your contact information, DNS records, and your domain's
                        registration payments. If you choose this option, your domain needs to meet certain conditions in
                        order to be transferable. Read more about the conditions that need to exist before transferring your
                        domain.Tip:Most yearly Premium plans offer a one year free domain voucher that can be used to claim
                        a new domain, or for one year of free registration when you transfer your domain to Wix.Connecting
                        secondary domains to your siteYour primary domain is usually the domain name you choose when you
                        first purchase your domain from Wix. You can choose a different domain as your primary domain, but
                        you can only have one primary domain.Secondary domains redirect to your primary domain. You can
                        easily connect secondary domains to this primary domain. You can add an unlimited number of Wix
                        domains, or up to six externally-purchased domains, to a single Wix site. If you're connecting an
                        additional domain purchased elsewhere, you must first connect the domain in your account before you
                        can set it up to redirect to your primary domain.Learn more about connecting multiple domains to
                        your Wix site.Connecting subdomains to your siteA subdomain is a domain that is part of a larger
                        domain. It is related to the main or root domain and is the portion to the left of your URL. (e.g.
                        'shop.mywebsite.com' may be a subdomain that is part of your main domain URL 'mywebsite.com'). You
                        can connect subdomains in your Wix account. For example, if you own the root domain
                        mystunningwebsite.com, you can connect blog.mystunningwebsite.com to your blog website. Read our
                        subdomains overview for more information. Learn how to connect a subdomain to your main Wix

                        domain connection to become active? After connecting your domain, these new records can take up to
                        48 hours to propagate. During this time you may notice your site not loading, loading
                        inconsistently, or loading a message which says 'Not Secure'. Learn more about domain propagation.
                        If I connect my domain to Wix via name servers, where are my billing and contact details for my
                        domain hosted?Billing and contact details are managed at your current domain host, not at Wix.
                        Contact your existing domain host for assistance with domain renewals, contact information, and
                        other domain-related billing inquiries.Can I switch to a different connection method even if I've
                        already started connecting my domain? Yes. You can change the connection method for your domain at
                        any time by removing and re-adding the domain to your Wix account. Learn more about switching your
                        domain connection method.

                        below to learn more:Can I use Google services in all countries/regions?Google Workspace is available
                        in most countries and regions. However, Google does not allow access to some of its services in
                        certain countries/regions, such as China, Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.
                        For more detailed information about Google Workspace availability, you can contact Google Workspace
                        Support. How much does a business email cost? Business email prices depend on a few factors,
                        including the Google Workspace plan you choose. Business emails are purchased separately from
                        Premium plans.Note: You don't need an active Premium plan to purchase a business email.Can I
                        purchase more than one business email? You can purchase several emails for each domain, for example,
                        info@mystunningwebsite.com and support@mystunningwebsite.com. If you have already purchased a Google
                        Workspace email, you can also purchase additional emails for the same domain. Is there any limit on
                        the amount of business emails I can buy? You can buy up to 500 business emails, but you can only
                        purchase 20 per transaction. For example, if you want to have 100 business emails, you need to
                        purchase them 20 at a time - so you would need to make five transactions.What do I need to do to
                        activate my business email? Once you purchase your business email, accept the Google Terms of
                        Service in the business email admin account, and verify your domain if prompted, your business
                        account is activated and should be fully functional within 24 hours. What can I do if I am
                        experiencing issues with the authentication process? After submitting your purchase, your bank may
                        require you to verify your identity. If you're experiencing any issues with the authentication
                        process, contact your bank directly. Learn more about Strong Customer Authentication.What happens if
                        I try to purchase an email address I already own?If you try to purchase an email address you already
                        own (existing in your WIx account or outside it), you will see a message explaining that it is not
                        available because it already belongs to you. The purchase will not go through.For an email address
                        bought through Wix, check your business email page in your site. For an email address bought outside
                        of Wix, contact your external provider.How long should I wait after purchasing a business email in
                        order to set it up?After purchasing your business email, wait up to 5 minutes before beginning the
                        setup process.What happens if I don't accept the Terms of Service?If you don't accept the Terms of
                        Service in the business email admin account, your email will be suspended. You will then need to
                        contact Wix Customer Care and may need to carry out some further verifications.
